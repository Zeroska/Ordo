"""
ir_refs.py — the loader every module uses to read its tunable REFERENCE DATA out of
`references/*.json` instead of hardcoding it in Python (contributor RULE 3).

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
An analyst must be able to extend a denylist, a provider registry or a threshold WITHOUT
editing Python and without a redeploy. Code holds the *matching logic*; the values it matches
against are DATA. Before this loader existed the same denylists were pasted into five or six
modules and drifted apart — one module knew about a privacy proxy the next one did not, so the
same false cluster came back through whichever module was stale.

THE CONTRACT
------------
A reference file is a JSON object. Keys beginning with `_` are documentation and are ignored.
Every other key is a GROUP, in one of three shapes:

    "group": {"_comment": "...", "values": [ ... ]}        -> loaded as a list
    "group": {"_comment": "...", "entries": { ... }}       -> loaded as a dict (order preserved)
    "group": {"_comment": "...", "min": 7, "max": 15}      -> loaded as a dict of scalars

A bare list or object is accepted too, so an older file without the wrapper still loads.

FAILURE MODE — NEVER SILENT
---------------------------
`load_ref()` takes the caller's minimal embedded FALLBACK. If the file is missing, unparseable,
or missing a group, the fallback is used for exactly what is broken and a WARNING goes to stderr.
It never fails open silently: a filter that quietly returns False everywhere manufactures false
clusters, which is worse than crashing.

VENDORED ON PURPOSE
-------------------
WebPivot / BinaryPivot / tools-kb each ship an identical copy of this loader, because the skills
are imported onto other machines standalone and must not depend on a repo-root package.
`tests/test_references.py` asserts the copies stay byte-identical.
