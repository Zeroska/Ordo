description: Render a finished assessment MARKDOWN file into a polished, report-ready PDF and/or editable DOCX using pandoc — with a muted editorial house template that matches IntelGraph (cover page, table of contents, running header/footer carrying the classification + case id, embedded figures, and Vietnamese-safe typography). Use this skill WHENEVER the user has a written assessment/report in markdown (e.g. from pivot_extract --report, evidence_report, or an IntelHarness assessment) and asks to "make a PDF", "export to Word/docx", "produce the report", "render the report", "turn this into a document", "beautiful report", or "deliverable". Produces both PDF and DOCX by default. FULLY BILINGUAL EN/VI via --lang: the generated furniture (cover labels, table of contents, "Phụ lục", figure/table captions) is localised and a Vietnamese-capable font is picked, while the body stays the analyst's — with a fixed ICD-203 estimative glossary (`--glossary`) so the confidence scale does not drift in translation. USE ALSO WHEN Vietnamese report, báo cáo tiếng Việt, report in Vietnamese, bilingual report, localise the report, Vietnamese deliverable, xuất báo cáo PDF.

# IntelReport — markdown → polished PDF / DOCX

Turn a finished assessment written in Markdown into a credible, print-native document.
The house style is the same understated editorial look as IntelGraph — muted slate/steel
palette, no gradients, generous margins, the kind of report a SOC analyst files, not an
auto-generated dashboard. **PDF** is the shareable deliverable; **DOCX** is the editable
copy a reviewer can redline.

## Report structure — house rules (follow for EVERY report)

These are the standing rules for the assessment markdown you hand to the renderer. The template
enforces the typography (Roman numbering, compact tables, wrapped code); YOU enforce the structure.

1. **Important-first, detail-later.** Lead the document with the conclusion. Section **I** is always
   the **Executive Summary — Key Judgments (BLUF)**: a table of findings + attribution + confidence,
   before any narrative.
1a. **Write in IC / CIA estimative language.** The analyst voice is *"We assess…"*, *"We judge with
   high confidence…"*, *"…almost certainly…"*. Use the **ICD-203 / Sherman-Kent** probability words
   (almost certain / very likely / likely / roughly even chance / unlikely / very unlikely / almost
   no chance) in the PROSE, not just the tables — and never mix a percentage with the word in the
   same clause. State an explicit **confidence level** (low / moderate / high) for each key judgment.
1b. **Explanatory, cause-and-effect narrative — show the trail.** A reader (not just an analyst)
   must be able to FOLLOW how each finding was reached. Write it as *found → via → therefore*:
   name what you did, what it returned, and what that let you conclude. Prefer plain sentences over
   terse shorthand. Estimative words still carry the confidence, but the sentence explains itself.
   - Shorthand (avoid): *"Shared origin IP 203.0.113.10 (AS64500); same-day reg 2020-01-01 → same operator."*
   - Explanatory (use): *"When we reverse-looked-up the two sites' hosting, both resolved to the same
     server (203.0.113.10, a small VPS that hosts almost nothing else); and WHOIS shows both domains
     were registered on the same day through the same registrar. Because a shared private server and a
     same-day registration are things unrelated operators do not share by accident, we assess the two
     sites are run by one operator."*
2. **Table → info → context, in that order.** In every finding section, put the structured table
   first, then the tight bullet/number facts, then the prose context. Never open with a paragraph.
3. **Overview → Details in every long section.** If a section runs long, split it: a `## Overview`
   (2–4 lines) then `## Details`. The reader gets the gist without reading the whole section.
   **Write the heading text only — never type the number.** The template numbers sections itself,
   so `## 4.1 Overview` renders as "4.1 4.1 Overview". Same for appendix sub-headings.
4. **Roman top-level, arabic sub.** Use `#` for top-level sections (rendered `I`, `II`, …) and `##`
   for sub-sections (`I.1`, `I.2`). Appendices come after a raw-LaTeX `\appendix` marker and render
   as `Appendix A`, `Appendix B` (see below).
5. **Methodology section (required), placed EARLY.** Put `# Methodology` immediately AFTER the
   Executive Summary (i.e. Section **II**), before the findings — the reader learns *how* the
   investigation was conducted before reading *what* it found. State the tools and the collection
   process so the work can be reproduced or challenged.
5a. **Keep index columns narrow.** A leading `#`/`No.` column must not eat width — give it a tiny
   share by making its delimiter dashes short relative to the others, e.g.
   `| # | Judgment | … |` with `|:-:|:------------------|…|` (one dash for `#`, many for the rest).
   Pandoc allocates column width by the dash ratio. Better still, drop the index column unless rows
   are cited by number.
5b. **Page breaks are automatic.** The template starts every top-level section on a fresh page
   (`\sectionbreak=\clearpage`) — do NOT add manual `\newpage`. Author in **Markdown** and let
   `render_report.py` port to LaTeX; never hand-write LaTeX (markdown is far cheaper in tokens and
   pandoc does the conversion for free).
6. **Confidence via BOTH the NATO Admiralty matrix AND ICD 203.** Grade each source/artifact with an
   Admiralty code (source reliability **A–F** × information credibility **1–6**) and express each
   analytic judgment with an ICD-203 probability word. Include the two reference tables in Methodology:

   | Reliability | Meaning | | Credibility | Meaning |
   |---|---|---|---|---|
   | A | Completely reliable | | 1 | Confirmed by other sources |
   | B | Usually reliable | | 2 | Probably true |
   | C | Fairly reliable | | 3 | Possibly true |
   | D | Not usually reliable | | 4 | Doubtful |
   | E | Unreliable | | 5 | Improbable |
   | F | Reliability cannot be judged | | 6 | Truth cannot be judged |

   ICD-203 bands: *almost no chance* (01–05%) · *very unlikely* (05–20) · *unlikely* (20–45) ·
   *roughly even chance* (45–55) · *likely* (55–80) · *very likely* (80–95) · *almost certain* (95–99%).
7. **Appendix — artifact register (required).** The last section is an appendix table with ONE ROW
   PER ARTIFACT, columns: **Artifact · Value · Source (public class) · Admiralty grade** — this is the
   authoritative schema (Rule 13 restates it). "Source" is the PUBLIC source CLASS only — WHOIS,
   passive DNS / IP, certificate transparency, public web-scan data, live page — never a specific
   product/vendor, an internal file path, a tool/script name, or a "how we found it" column (that
   would leak methodology; see Rules 12 & 14). Grade every row with its Admiralty code (source
   reliability **A–F** × information credibility **1–6**).
8. **Wrap code in a code block.** Any config/JSON/command goes in a fenced ```` ``` ```` block — the
   template line-wraps it so it never overflows the page. Never paste code as prose.
9. **Compact, text-heavy tables are fine.** The template shrinks table font automatically; prefer a
   dense table over splitting facts into prose. Use grid tables when cells hold long text.
10. **No "prepared by" / analyst identity.** Never add a "Prepared by…", author, or sign-off line.
    The cover already carries the reference, date, and classification; that is the whole provenance block.
11. **External reference ≠ internal case id (OPSEC), tracked in a private registry.** The document
    displays a report reference (`report_id` / `--report-ref`) that DIFFERS from the internal case
    folder — a leaked report must not tie back to the store. The renderer **auto-maintains the map**
    in `cases/report_registry.jsonl` (git-ignored): it derives the internal case from the report's
    path under `cases/<id>/`, and if no reference is given it **reuses** the one already logged for
    that case (reproducible) or **mints** `RPT-YYYY-MMDD-NN`. Every render records
    `{report_ref → case_id, title, date, outputs}` there, so we can always resolve a reference
    privately (`grep <ref> cases/report_registry.jsonl`) while the shared PDF never carries the case id.
12. **Never expose internal working anywhere in the report.** No internal tool / script / MCP / API
    names (the collectors, the KB, the registry, Claude APIs), no internal file paths, no case-store
    ids. In the body and appendix, cite only **public source CLASSES** — WHOIS, passive DNS / IP,
    certificate transparency, public web-scan data, live page — never the specific product/service.

12a. **…but NEVER anonymise the EVIDENCE. Rule 12 restricts how we say we found something, never
    what we found.** These are two different categories and confusing them destroys the report.
    The test is **who authored the string**:

    | Category | Authored by | Rule |
    |---|---|---|
    | **Internal working** | *our* investigation — tool / script / MCP / API names, the KB, the case-store id, file paths, command lines, data-vendor product names | **Never appears.** Cite the public source CLASS instead. |
    | **Case evidence** | *the target* — domains, URLs, IPs, ASNs, hashes, favicon mmh3, cert fingerprints, registrant strings, wallets, handles, impersonated brand names, dates | **Always appears, literally.** This IS the deliverable. |

    A section headed "The seed and its lifecycle" that never states the seed's domain name, or a
    finding written as "a US wealth-management brand" instead of naming it, has **failed** — the
    reader cannot verify it, act on it, or follow the argument. Describing the *sector* of a brand
    is not OPSEC; it is an unreadable report.

12b. **Name every reference at FIRST MENTION in the body — not only in the appendix.**
    - **The SEED is named in the Executive Summary**, and again in the first line of the section
      that analyses it. A reader must never reach the appendix to learn what the case is about.
    - **First body mention of any indicator carries its literal value**: write
      `login.site-a.example (203.0.113.10 · AS64500)`, not "the login host". Later mentions may
      shorten once the value has been given.
    - **Impersonated brands are named** — "imitates *Example Brokerage Ltd*", never "a large broker".
    - **Every claim carries the reference it rests on.** If a sentence asserts a shared artifact, the
      artifact's value appears in that sentence or in its table row.
    - **Enumerate the cluster.** If the finding is "N domains", an appendix lists all N by name.
    - Vague (fails): *"Two members share a favicon; the seed imitates a broker."*
    - Named (passes): *"`site-a.example` and `site-b.example` both serve favicon mmh3 `123456789`;
      the seed `site-a.example` imitates Example Brokerage Ltd."*
13. **Appendix = collected EVIDENCE only.** The final appendix is the evidence table: **Artifact ·
    Value · Source (public class) · Admiralty grade**. No "how we found it", no file paths, no
    reproduction/credit-log appendix. It is what we observed, not how our harness observed it.
14. **Methodology overview = general OSINT tradecraft, not our process.** Describe the *method*
    (start from seeds → **pivot** outward → form a **hypothesis** → **prove or disprove** it against
    independent data sources → weight owner-controlled evidence, state the alternative ruled out),
    never the specific tools/commands. The NATO + ICD reference tables still follow.
15. **EVERY findings section carries a figure. This is MANDATORY, not a nicety.** Invoking
    IntelReport ALWAYS chains to IntelGraph. A report that renders with zero figures has failed the
    checklist — go back and author them before presenting. The rule is **one figure per top-level
    findings section** (III onward: the seed, each cluster/entity, the attribution argument, the
    rejected links), plus one whole-case overview at the end. Executive Summary and Methodology
    need none.
    - **The figure's job is to show HOW the connection was made, not to decorate.** A reader should
      be able to read the picture alone and follow *observed artifact → link it creates → what we
      concluded → with what confidence*. Label the EDGES with the evidence (`shared favicon
      123456789`, `same-day registration`, `regulator register`), not with vague verbs.
    - **Mark the verdict on the graph.** Confirmed links solid, assessed/probable links dashed,
      **rejected links dotted and struck through with the reason** (`✗ parking IP — co-tenancy
      noise`). A figure that shows only what survived hides the analysis; showing the discarded
      branch is what makes the attribution credible.
16. **Two figure kinds — use both.** `figures.json` (sibling of the markdown) takes a *list*, and
    `render_report.py` rebuilds every entry through IntelGraph immediately before rendering, so no
    chart is ever stale. Opt out only with `--no-figures`.
    - **COLLECTED — a case graph from the raw collection JSON.** Best for "these N hosts share these
      artifacts". Prune noise node types so the meaningful nodes render large:
      `{"raw":["../raw/a.json", …], "graph":"cluster_a.json", "stem":"fig_cluster_a",
      "title":"…", "direction":"LR", "legend":true,
      "drop_types":["nameserver","registrar","template","theme","email"]}`
    - **REASONING — a hand-authored Mermaid source.** Best for the argument a collected graph cannot
      express: corporate/entity structure, an ownership timeline, the inference chain from artifact
      to attribution, the alternative hypothesis that was ruled out:
      `{"mmd":"fig_attribution.mmd", "stem":"fig_attribution", "theme":"neutral"}`
      Author the `.mmd` next to the markdown (`flowchart LR`, or `timeline` / `gantt` for chronology)
      and let the renderer produce the PNG/SVG triple.
    - Embed the result as a centred block; the renderer sets `\graphicspath` so a raw
      ` ```{=latex}\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=...]{fig_x_hires.png}\end{center}``` `
      resolves. Follow every figure with a one-line italic caption stating what it proves.
    - **Multiple small figures beat one dense overview.** Three focused graphs are followed far more
      easily than one 30-node hairball. Build each section's figure from only that section's hosts.
    - **Keep labels short or the figure prints unreadable.** A figure is scaled to the text block
      (~16 cm), so its rendered PIXEL WIDTH sets the type size: at 1000 px wide the labels print
      around 7 pt; at 1700 px they print under 4 pt and no one can read them. Cap node labels at
      ~8 words / 3 short lines, collapse a fan of sibling nodes into one multi-line node, and switch
      `LR`→`TB` when a chain runs long. **Check the rendered width** — if `<stem>_hires.png` comes
      back wider than ~1200 px, cut text or restructure, don't just shrink the `includegraphics`
      width. The detail belongs in the prose; the figure carries the argument.
    - **A Mermaid `subgraph` title does not reserve vertical space when it wraps.** A title longer
      than its box renders the second line *underneath the first node*, so the identifier you most
      wanted read is the one that vanishes — and the `.mmd` source looks perfectly correct either
      way. Keep subgraph titles to a few words (`Victim DNS zone`) and put the domain or IP in a
      NODE, which lays out properly. **Open the rendered PNG before shipping**; this class of
      defect is invisible in the source.

17. **Always include per-domain profiles.** A report must carry a "Domain & infrastructure profiles"
    appendix — one small **Field · Value** table per domain covering, at minimum: status
    (live / dead / parked), registrar + **created** date, registrant (country / org, noting privacy
    masking), nameservers, origin host (IP · ASN), and the **distinctive artifacts** found on that
    site (favicon mmh3, TLS SHA-256, analytics/telemetry ids, tech stack, contact handles, notable
    sub-sites). This is the WHOIS + unique-findings dossier a reader expects for every domain in scope.

Note: top-level sections are Roman (I, II); sub-sections number as **arabic `1.1`, `2.1`** (not I.1).

## Audience — ASK first, then tailor the report

A report has a reader, and different readers need different reports. When the user asks to "produce
/ output / render a report" **without naming the audience, ASK before writing** — use
`AskUserQuestion` with these options (add "All three" — render one file per profile):

| Profile | Reader | Tone & length | Lead with | Include | Cut / push to appendix |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Technical** | analyst, IR, threat-intel | precise, dense, jargon OK | the two-layer finding + evidence tables | every artifact, exact IOCs, Admiralty/ICD grades, config dumps, methodology depth | nothing — this is the full build |
| **Executive** | leadership, decision-maker | plain business language, short (≤2 pp body) | 3–5 bullet BLUF: what it is, our exposure, the ONE recommendation | risk/impact framing, cost, "what it means for us", a single clear action | raw indicators, tool names, hashes → appendix only |
| **Law Enforcement** | investigator, prosecutor | neutral, factual, court-mindful; separate *confirmed* from *assessed* | the actors/infrastructure + the evidence chain | provenance (source/where/how) up front, UTC timestamps, jurisdictions (registrar, hosting country, offshore), preservation targets, and the concrete legal-process leads (who to subpoena: registrar, NS/anonymity provider, host, telemetry vendor, scanner submitter) | speculation and analyst labels unless clearly marked as assessment |

All three still obey the house rules above (Exec Summary first, Methodology second, NATO+ICD,
artifact appendix, explanatory tone). The audience changes *emphasis, depth, and vocabulary* — not
the underlying facts. Carry the choice into the render with `--audience {technical|executive|le}`
(it stamps the audience on the cover subtitle and sets a sensible TOC depth).

## Handling marking (TLP) — ASK first, never assume

Every report carries a handling caveat on the cover and on **every** page. It tells the reader what
they may do with the document, so it is the author's decision, not a default. When the user asks to
"produce / output / render a report" **without stating the marking, ASK before rendering** — use
`AskUserQuestion` (FIRST TLP 2.0; offer `TLP:AMBER+STRICT` via "Other"):

| Marking | Reader may share it with | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| **TLP:CLEAR** | anyone, publicly | blog posts, LinkedIn/social, published research, awareness material |
| **TLP:GREEN** | their community / peer network, not publicly | industry or trust-group circulation |
| **TLP:AMBER** | their own organisation and clients, need-to-know | the default for a live case assessment naming victims or an active operator |
| **TLP:RED** | named recipients only, no onward sharing | pre-takedown, pre-arrest, or single-recipient briefings |

Do NOT silently accept the tool's `UNCLASSIFIED` fallback, and do not inherit a marking from a
neighbouring file just because it was there. Pass the answer through as
`--classification "TLP:<LEVEL>"` (or frontmatter `classification:`).

**Downgrading is a redaction job, not a re-render.** Re-marking changes the banner, not the content.
Before producing a `TLP:CLEAR` / `TLP:GREEN` cut of anything that was `AMBER` or `RED`, re-read it as
a stranger and tell the user what publishing would disclose — compromised third-party hostnames and
their owners (victims, not suspects), registrant PII, non-public source material, anything that tips
an operator off before a takedown. Offer a redacted variant that keeps the tradecraft and the key
judgments but masks the victim identifiers; the operator's own infrastructure normally stays.

**Never overwrite the higher-marked file.** Render the downgraded cut to a NEW output stem
(`<report>_public`), so the original stays as the record copy of what was assessed and when.

### The appendix marker (Roman → letter switch)

Pandoc has no `\appendix` hook, so emit one raw-LaTeX block in the markdown immediately before the
first appendix heading — everything after it numbers as `Appendix A`, `B`, …:

````markdown
```{=latex}
\appendix
```

# Artifact register
````

## Zero new dependencies

Everything is already on the machine the harness uses:
- `pandoc` — the converter (markdown → PDF and → DOCX).
- `xelatex` — the PDF engine (Unicode/Vietnamese-safe; picks an installed Vietnamese-capable
  font automatically, see below).

No Python packages are required — `render_report.py` is stdlib-only and shells out to pandoc.

## Running the tool — paths (read first)

Registered as `IntelReport`, symlinked to the repo's `IntelReport/` folder.

```bash
REPORT=~/.claude/skills/IntelReport            # absolute — works from any CWD (preferred)
# or, inside the repo:  REPORT="$ROOT/IntelReport"

python3 "$REPORT/scripts/render_report.py" assessment.md out/report
```

That writes `out/report.pdf` **and** `out/report.docx` (both by default). Pass `--pdf` or
`--docx` to produce just one.

## Core workflow

1. **Have the assessment as Markdown.** Any assessment markdown works — from
   `pivot_extract.py --report`, `evidence_report.py`, an IntelHarness assessment, or written
   by hand. Standard Markdown: `#`/`##` headings, `|` pipe tables, fenced code, `**bold**`,
   `> quotes`, and image embeds.
2. **(Optional) add YAML frontmatter** so the cover/header fill in without CLI flags:
   ```markdown
   ---
   title: "Operator A — infrastructure assessment"
   subtitle: "Passive OSINT · N sites attributed to one operator"
   case_id: CASE-0001
   classification: "TLP:AMBER"
   lang: vi          # optional — Vietnamese cover/TOC/captions; the BODY is never translated
   ---
   ```
   CLI flags (`--title`, `--case-id`, `--classification`, `--subtitle`, `--date`, `--lang`) override
   the frontmatter. Anything missing gets a sensible default (`classification` →
   `UNCLASSIFIED`, `date` → UTC today, `title` → first `#` heading or the filename).
   The `classification` fallback is a backstop, not an answer — **ask the user for the TLP**
   (see *Handling marking* above) rather than letting a report ship as `UNCLASSIFIED`.
3. **Embed IntelGraph figures** as ordinary Markdown images — the alt text becomes the
   figure caption, styled in the house palette:
   ```markdown
   ![Operator A — two sites, shared GA4 + registrant](case_diagram_hires.png)
   ```
   Image paths are resolved **relative to the markdown file's directory**. Put the assessment
   `.md` in the case folder next to its figures (see the IntelGraph output contract) and they
   embed cleanly. Use the `_hires.png` (300 DPI) figure for print, or the `.svg` for vector.
4. **Render:**
   ```bash
   python3 "$REPORT/scripts/render_report.py" cases/CASE-0001/assessment.md \
       cases/CASE-0001/report --case-id CASE-0001 --classification "TLP:AMBER"
   ```
5. **Present** the PDF (and DOCX if the user wants to edit it).

## The end-to-end pipeline (charts + report)

```bash
# 1) collect + build the clustered case graph (WebPivot)
python3 <WebPivot>/tools/graph_build.py cases/CASE-0001/raw/*.json \
    --operator "Operator A" -o cases/CASE-0001/case_graph.json

# 2) editable diagram -> PNG/SVG (IntelGraph); the .mmd is hand-editable
python3 <IntelGraph>/scripts/graph_to_diagram.py cases/CASE-0001/case_graph.json \
    cases/CASE-0001/case_diagram --title "One operator, N sites" --legend

# 3) reference the figure in the assessment markdown, then render the document
python3 <IntelReport>/scripts/render_report.py cases/CASE-0001/assessment.md \
    cases/CASE-0001/report --case-id CASE-0001 --classification "TLP:AMBER"
```

`<IntelGraph>` = `~/.claude/skills/IntelGraph`, `<WebPivot>` = `~/.claude/skills/WebPivot`.

## Template & house style

- **Cover page** — classification banner (brick), large slate title, grey subtitle, and a
  Case / Date / Basis block. No logo, no analyst name.
- **Body** — numbered sections in slate/steel sans headings with a hairline rule, booktabs
  tables, house-palette figure captions, coloured hyperlinks. Auto table of contents.
- **Header/footer** — classification top-left, case id top-right, classification + page
  number in the footer, hairline rules.
- The LaTeX template is `templates/house-header.tex` (xelatex, palette copied from
  `IntelGraph/scripts/theme.py`). Edit it to adjust the house look; keep it case-data-free.

## Vietnamese reports — `--lang vi`

A report has two kinds of text, and the tool treats them differently **on purpose**.

| | Who writes it | What `--lang vi` does |
|---|---|---|
| **Furniture** — cover labels, TOC title, "Appendix", figure/table captions, the audience stamp | the template | **swaps it wholesale** (`Số hiệu` / `Ngày` / `Cơ sở thu thập` / `Mục lục` / `Phụ lục` / `Hình` / `Bảng`) |
| **Body** — the argument, the judgments, the evidence | the analyst | **nothing. It is never machine-translated.** |

That split is the whole design. The furniture is finite and mechanical, so localising it is a
one-line flag. The body is a *calibrated* text: "we assess with high confidence" and "likely" are
ICD-203 terms with probability bands attached, and a paraphrase of one silently changes what the
report claims. So **write the assessment in Vietnamese from the start** and take the wording
verbatim from the glossary:

```bash
python3 "$REPORT/scripts/render_report.py" --glossary --lang vi   # the exact strings to use
python3 "$REPORT/scripts/render_report.py" assessment.md out/report --lang vi --pdf --docx
```

Or set it once in frontmatter — `lang: vi` — alongside `title:` / `classification:`.

**Rules for a Vietnamese deliverable:**

1. **Use the glossary strings verbatim, never a synonym.** `rất có khả năng` (80–95%) and
   `có khả năng` (55–80%) are different claims. Quote the ICD-203 band table once in
   *Phương pháp và mức độ tin cậy* so the reader can grade the scale instead of guessing.
2. **Never mix confidence with probability in one sentence.** `độ tin cậy` is about the evidence;
   `khả năng` is about the event. Same rule as English, same failure if broken.
3. **Keep the house skeleton.** Use the `section_names` headings so a Vietnamese and an English
   rendering of the same case are a translation of each other, not two different reports.
4. **Indicators stay literal and untranslated** — domains, IPs, hashes, brand names, registrar
   names. Rules 12a/12b apply unchanged; a translated indicator is a broken indicator.
5. **Check the PDF for tofu.** `--lang vi` warns loudly when no installed family *declares*
   Vietnamese coverage, but it still renders — look at the output before sending it.

Both languages live in `references/report_i18n.json` (RULE 3). Add a third by adding its key to
every group; nothing in the code needs to change.

### Fonts

`render_report.py` auto-selects an installed serif + sans that actually **declare Vietnamese
coverage** (`fc-list :lang=vi`) — many otherwise-nice serifs (PT Serif, Charter, DejaVu on
macOS) miss the stacked-diacritic glyphs (ộ, ừ, ả) and render tofu, so they are skipped in
favour of e.g. Noto Serif / Georgia / Times. Diacritics render correctly (cà phê, Hà Nội,
lừa đảo). Latin Modern is the last-resort TeX-bundled fallback — it does **not** cover
Vietnamese, so on a box with no fontconfig install a Noto family:
`brew install --cask font-noto-serif font-noto-sans` / `apt install fonts-noto`.

### DOCX styling

DOCX uses pandoc's default reference styling plus a title block (title / subtitle-with-
classification / date). To brand it further, drop a customised `templates/reference.docx`
into the skill — `render_report.py` picks it up automatically if present (else uses the
clean default). Generate a starting point with
`pandoc -o templates/reference.docx --print-default-data-file reference.docx`, restyle it in
Word/LibreOffice, and keep it case-data-free.

## Quality checklist before presenting

- Both requested files exist (PDF and/or DOCX).
- **Figures rendered and embedded (Rule 15) — check this FIRST, it is the most-skipped step.**
  `figures.json` exists, the render log printed `figure refreshed:` for every entry, every findings
  section from III onward embeds one, and each figure's edges are labelled with the EVIDENCE that
  creates the link. Zero figures = the report is not finished.
- Cover shows the right title, case id, and classification; NO analyst name.
- Vietnamese text renders with correct diacritics (no tofu boxes) — and for a `--lang vi` report,
  the cover/TOC/appendix furniture is Vietnamese too, the estimative terms match the glossary
  verbatim, and no indicator was translated.
- Embedded figures appear (use the `_hires.png`); tables render with rules.
- Header/footer carry the classification + case id + page numbers on every body page.
- The classification and report reference came from an argument or frontmatter — never hardcoded,
  and the displayed reference is the EXTERNAL `--report-ref`, not the internal case id (Rule 11).
- **The TLP was the user's explicit answer**, not a default or a marking inherited from a
  neighbouring file — and no report shipped as `UNCLASSIFIED` by omission. If this is a downgraded
  public cut, the disclosure review happened and the higher-marked original was not overwritten.
- **Identifier disclosure (Rules 12a/12b) — check explicitly, it is the most common defect:**
  - the SEED's domain name appears in the Executive Summary;
  - every impersonated brand is named, not described by sector;
  - every indicator's literal value appears at its first mention in the BODY, not only the appendix;
  - if the finding counts N domains, an appendix lists all N;
  - and, in the other direction, no tool / script / vendor-product / case-store id survives anywhere.
  Read one findings section as a stranger: if you cannot tell WHICH domain it is about, rewrite it.
