"""audit.py — the harness's tool-call GATE and LEDGER, shared by all three front-ends.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Two invariants were being asserted in comments and enforced nowhere:

  1. "the agent does not directly bypass permissions" — the SDK driver ran with
     `permission_mode="bypassPermissions"` and the only guardrails lived INSIDE individual
     tools (pivot_extract's hostile-egress refusal, bp_anyrun's submission gate). A tool that
     forgot to implement its own gate had nothing above it, and the two other front-ends
     (the OpenAI/DeepSeek shim, the stdio MCP server) shared none of that logic.
  2. "all high-risk actions leave evidence" — true for METERED API credits
     (MEMORY/api_usage.jsonl) and for model cost (run_cost.jsonl), but the tool calls
     themselves were only printed to stderr. A finished run's *decisions* were auditable;
     its *actions* were not.

This module is the one policy point both invariants need. It is deliberately front-end
neutral: it takes a tool name and its arguments, returns allow/deny, and appends one JSON
line per call to the ledger — regardless of who is calling.

  SDK driver (Anthropic)   orchestrator._phase installs a PreToolUse HOOK per phase
  DeepSeek / OpenAI shim   openai_backend.query calls gate() before invoking a handler
  Claude Code (stdio MCP)  mcp_server._call_tool calls gate() before invoking a handler

WHY A PreToolUse HOOK AND NOT `can_use_tool`
--------------------------------------------
`can_use_tool` looks like the right seam and is not: the SDK only consults it for calls that
would otherwise PROMPT the user. Two things the harness does on purpose both shadow it —
`permission_mode="bypassPermissions"`, and `allowed_tools` entries that allow a whole tool
(which is exactly what COLLECT_TOOLS / ANALYZE_TOOLS are). The SDK says so itself, in
`ClaudeAgentOptions.can_use_tool`'s docstring and by emitting `CanUseToolShadowedWarning`:
"To observe or gate *every* tool call regardless of permission rules, use a PreToolUse hook."
So the gate is a hook. The callback is built per phase as a CLOSURE over that phase's case and
label, because phases run CONCURRENTLY (collect fan-out, parallel cluster judgment) and the
hook fires on the SDK's own task — a module-global or a ContextVar would cross-contaminate.

WHAT IT DENIES (everything else is allowed, and still logged)
-------------------------------------------------------------
  * hostile posture + an OUTBOUND tool with no passive/proxy argument
  * an APPROVAL-REQUIRED tool (sandbox submission) without its env var set
  * a METERED call once the run's credit-spend budget is exhausted
The lists, the budget and the env-var map are DATA — see references/tool_policy.json — so an
analyst re-classifies a tool without editing this file. A denial is returned to the MODEL as
text, so it can adapt (re-call with passive=true / free_only=true) rather than dying.
