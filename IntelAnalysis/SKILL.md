# IntelAnalysis — the analyst's brain

This is the **reasoning layer**, not a collector. Collectors (WebPivot, future
`osint-ip`/`osint-ioc`) gather attributed facts into `knowledge/`. IntelAnalysis reads
that store and applies **investigative judgment**: which facts matter, what they prove,
how confident to be, and what to chase next. It writes assessments; it does not fetch.

**Deterministic-first still holds.** Correlation math (dedup, shared-indicator detection,
clustering) is code — call `tools/kb/query.py` and `WebPivot/tools/graph_build.py`. Use
model reasoning only for the parts code can't do: weighing evidence, resolving conflicts,
forming and falsifying hypotheses, and deciding the next move. Run this skill on the
strongest model (Opus / Fable); the collectors run cheap.

## Running the tools — paths & working directory (read first)

Run every command below from the `intelligence_assist` **project root** (where `knowledge/`,
`cases/`, and `tools/` live). `tools/kb/query.py` and the KB store are project-root-relative —
they are not inside this skill folder, so `cd` to the project root first (`cd "$ROOT"`).

## Inputs / outputs

- **Reads:** the knowledge base.
  ```bash
  python3 tools/kb/query.py --kb knowledge --stats
  python3 tools/kb/query.py --kb knowledge --shared --min 2      # cluster seeds (start here)
  python3 tools/kb/query.py --kb knowledge --cluster <domain>    # peers of a domain
  python3 tools/kb/query.py --kb knowledge --entity <value>      # one entity, facts + edges + provenance
  ```
- **Writes (output contract — every assessment is persisted, not just spoken):**
  1. A cited assessment file at a **fixed path**: `knowledge/reports/<case>/assessment.md`,
     following the §7 schema exactly (BLUF → Cluster table → Attribution → Gaps & alternatives →
     Next steps). Writing the assessment only into the chat is not "done" — save the file, then
     summarize it in the reply. Re-running an assessment overwrites the same path.
  2. When your judgment changes a rating, the **updated confidence back into the store** (so the
     next run inherits it), keeping provenance.
  3. Optional but recommended: **invoke the `IntelGraph` skill** on the `case_graph.json` and drop
     the rendered `network.html` beside the report in `knowledge/reports/<case>/`.

## Method

```
Triage facts → Correlate into clusters → Attribute (same-kit vs same-operator vs same-actor)
   → Calibrate confidence → Form & falsify hypotheses → Prioritise next pivots → Write the assessment
   → Capture what it taught (register the operator + any new tell) so the next case starts ahead
```

**Before you start, load your priors + check what you already know.**
- Read `knowledge/analyst_profile.md` (your standing brief — thresholds, tells, house style; see
  `Workflows/AnalystProfile.md` to set it up and to feed in past reports with `ingest_report.py`).
- `intel.py open` prints a **prior-knowledge overlap** block after ingest — which seeds already
  connect to previously-seen domains and to any confirmed operator in `knowledge/operators.jsonl`.
  A `⚠ CONFIRMED-OPERATOR MATCH` means this isn't a new investigation, it's an extension of a closed
  one. Look up any domain with `python3 tools/kb/operator_registry.py find <domain>`.
- It also prints **scam red-flags** per seed (NRD / bulletproof-hosting / money-trail — see below and
  `references/RiskIndicators.md`). Run `python3 tools/kb/risk_signals.py --case <case>` anytime.

**Generate hypotheses, then break them.** `python3 tools/kb/hypothesize.py --kb knowledge --min 2`
turns the KB into falsifiable operator hypotheses — each with the disconfirming check and the open
questions to answer. It clusters ONLY on attribution-grade identity artifacts (same-operator ≠
same-kit) and drops proxy/high-fan-out noise. Full loop: `Workflows/Hypothesis.md`.

**When you finish, close the loop (`Workflows/Learn.md`).** Record the operator you assessed to the
registry and append any reusable tell to the "Captured (in-case)" blocks below — this is the
difference between a KB that grows and one that just accumulates.

## 0. Opening a case — first moves  ▢ TUNE  (in-case notes)

**Collect broad BEFORE you theorize.** The opening pass is deliberately maximal — get the
widest concrete footprint first, because the domain that looks central often isn't.

1. **Bulk-collect the whole set; don't narrow early.** Run WebPivot artifact extraction +
   WHOIS (current **and** history) + a page capture across *every* seed domain at once.
   Gather more than you think you need — correlation comes after collection, not during.
2. **Start from the seed / initial domain** — the one closest to the case origin (the tip
   that opened the case). Read it first, but do **not** assume it's the hub; the real broker
   is often a sibling (betweenness centrality tells you which, later).
3. **Read the naming pattern by eye** before tooling — brand families, TLD rotation,
   transliteration tells — to pre-guess sub-groups.
4. **Anchor on the registrant email / identity.** The email that registered the domains is
   the most concrete glue — build the spine from WHOIS (recover it from *history* when the
   current record is privacy-masked), then hang artifacts off that spine.
5. **Prioritise artifacts that are UNIQUE to the site or its paid services**, most-concrete first:
   registrant email/name → owner-account tokens (GA4/GTM, SEO/ads UUIDs, ahrefs/GSC/Bing) →
   **origin IP** (true backend, *not* the shared CDN/hosting edge — see §1) → on-page DOM
   artifacts the operator uses to get paid/contacted (phone, Zalo/Messenger, email, distinctive
   page schema/template), any comments that are unique to the build, and finally the favicon hash (stronger if it's a niche/custom kit). also check for a reused crypto wallet address (e.g. BTC, ETH, USDT) — if it's reused across sites, it's a strong same-operator artifact. Some typo of the website name in the domain name is also a medium signal of same-operator.
6. **Acquire by hostility.** Passive-first (Wayback / urlscan / crt.sh) for clearly adversarial
   targets; live fetch from a safe egress for low-risk ones. Judge per target, not one rule.

Executable recipe: `Workflows/OpenCase.md`.

## 1. Artifact triage ladder  ▢ TUNE WITH YOUR EXPERIENCE

Not all shared artifacts are equal. Rank every shared indicator before you reason about it.
Seeded from cases so far — **edit the tiers as you learn**:

| Tier | Weight | Artifacts | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Money-trail** | high | **reused crypto wallet** (btc/eth/usdt/tron), payment-processor/merchant id, registrant/on-page **phone**, contact **email**, IBAN/SWIFT | how the operator gets *paid* and *contacted* — the crucial category for loss/LE/takedown. A reused wallet = the same payee (attribution-grade). Now KB edges: `uses_wallet`, `shows_email`. See `references/RiskIndicators.md` |
| **Attribution-grade** | high | registrant email/name, GA4/GTM property, ahrefs/GSC verification token, favicon hash on a *niche/custom* kit, reused crypto wallet | private, owner-controlled — a stranger can't share these by accident |
| **Corroborating** | medium | Messenger/contact handle, phone, distinctive template/DOM-skeleton hash, self-hosted third-party host | meaningful with ≥1 attribution-grade artifact; weak alone |
| **Noise** | low / drop | Cloudflare name servers, generic registrar (GoDaddy/Porkbun), shared CDN host, common favicon (WordPress default), `googletagmanager.com` | shared by millions; near-zero attribution value — keep for completeness, never assert on |

**Infrastructure red-flags (raise the scam prior, not attribution):** `risk_signals.py` scores each
host for **NRD** (newly-registered — young + shared kit = one batch/operator), **bulletproof/abuse-
tolerant hosting** (registrar/NS/host match — a lead, verify origin IP vs CDN first), and the
**money-trail** above. A young unbranded site with a wallet + a Telegram/WhatsApp handle is the
archetypal payment funnel — `escalate`. Tunable lists: `references/risk_indicators.json`.

**Tells learned in-case (keep adding yours):**
- **Sequential GA/UA account numbers** = one operator batch-provisioned them in a sitting.
  A tight block like `UA-100000001` … `UA-100000009` across sibling sites is strong same-operator.
- **Shared WordPress theme** (e.g. `flatsome`) = weak-medium same-kit; **identical inline-CSS
  block or DOM-skeleton hash** across sites = stronger (same build, not just same theme).
- **Reverse-WHOIS count is a filter:** a registrant tied to a handful of thematically-coherent
  domains = attribution-grade; one tied to hundreds/thousands of unrelated domains = a shared
  reseller/agency = NOISE. Enforced by `tools/kb/ingest_reverse_whois.py --max-domains`. Reverse by
  **email**, **name**, or **phone** (`--email/--name/--phone`; `reverse_whois` MCP `kind=phone`) —
  all **preview the count first** and refuse to purchase/link a > `--max-domains` set without an
  explicit override (a registrant *phone* is especially prone to registrar-bulk noise, e.g. Dynadot).
- **Registrar/proxy contacts** (`abuse@`, `admin@onamae.com`, `registrar@inet.vn`, Domains-By-Proxy)
  and placeholder registrants ("domain expired", "Domain Admin C/O ID#…") are never the owner.
- **Origin IP ≠ hosting/CDN IP.** A shared *origin/backend* IP — a real server both
  sites resolve to, or an origin leaked from behind Cloudflare — is **attribution-grade infra**.
  A shared *edge/CDN/shared-host* IP (Cloudflare `104.21.x` / `172.67.x`, shared cPanel host) is
  **NOISE** — millions share it. Always resolve which kind before treating a shared IP as a link.
  *Enforced:* `WebPivot/tools/cdn_ranges.py` fetches published CDN/cloud ranges (Cloudflare,
  Fastly, AWS CloudFront, Google, BunnyCDN) and classifies each IP; `graph_build.py` drops
  CDN IPs and tags the rest `origin_candidate`. Run `cdn_ranges.py --update` to refresh ranges.
  Gap: CDNs with no public list (Akamai, Imperva) need ASN classification — see the tool's
  `NO_PUBLIC_LIST`.

▢ **Your rules:** _how you treat a GA4 ID that appears on 200 domains (link farm vs shared SEO agency); when a favicon is "niche" vs "off-the-shelf"; TLD-rotation patterns you've seen; Vietnamese-market registrar tells (Mat Bao, PA Vietnam, iNET)…_

**Captured (in-case — edit freely):**
- **Sequential handle aliases = one person.** `alias1@ / alias5@ / alias20@example.com` is one identity, not three. Normalize `name+<n>@` families to a single actor before counting.
- **A thematically-coherent registrant is attribution-grade even under privacy.** A single registrant name recurring across a thematically-coherent brand family (e.g. one seller's product-line domains) holds even when *current* WHOIS is a privacy proxy — recover it from WHOIS **history** (pre-privacy record), don't stop at the masked current record.
- **Mis-parsed / ad-network indicators are noise — drop, never assert.** `g-recaptcha` captured as a GA4 `G-` id (parser artifact); an AdSense `pub-…` or GA id shared across 80–100+ thematically-unrelated shops = a shared ad/SEO network, not one owner. (Same class as the reverse-WHOIS >200-domain reseller filter.)
- **Build fingerprints beat theme names.** A shared `wp_theme:<name>` is weak same-kit; an identical **HTML-comment hash / inline-CSS hash / DOM-skeleton** across sites is strong same-build — and reaches domains outside the seed list (a single HTML-comment fingerprint can span dozens of sites beyond the seed list).
- **Same WHOIS registration/expiry date = one batch, one actor.** Exact-same creation date (and the matching expiry, since expiry = created + term) across thematically-coherent domains means they were registered in one sitting by the same person — same class as sequential GA/UA numbers. Corroborating→same-operator; strongest with same registrar + a small coherent set, down-weight a huge set or a registrar bulk-promo default. In-case pattern: two thematically-related domains sharing one creation date (a 2nd signal beyond a shared phone); two brand-family domains sharing another creation date (bridging two sub-families). *Enforced:* `graph_build.py` models `regdate:<YYYY-MM-DD>` as a hub (day precision).

## 2. Correlation & the same-* distinction  ▢ TUNE

Three claims of increasing strength — never conflate them:

- **Same kit** — reused code/template/favicon. Says nothing about who runs it (kits are sold/shared).
- **Same operator** — shared *private* IDs/infra (GA4 property, verification token, registrant, wallet). One controller.
- **Same actor/person** — a named identity ties them (registrant name, reused email, phone).

**Corroboration rule (seeded):** assert *same-operator* only with **≥2 independent
attribution-grade artifacts**, or 1 attribution-grade + a named identity. One shared
generic artifact is a *lead*, not a finding.

▢ **Your thresholds:** _when you'll assert on a single artifact (which ones earn that trust); how you down-weight artifacts that co-occur because of a shared SEO/agency tool rather than a shared owner._

**Captured (in-case — edit freely):**
- **A shared phone / Zalo / Messenger handle is corroborating, never attribution.** Do NOT merge two clusters on a phone alone. Keep them separate until a registrant, verification token, or GA/GTM property confirms. (This is why an ID-card cluster bound only by a shared Zalo number should be assessed a *separate* operator, not folded into the main ring, until a registrant or token confirms.)
- **Resolve a theme-only cluster with a registrant lookup before asserting same-operator.** When sites bind only by a shared generic theme, run WHOIS registrant-name before deciding — that can reclassify a theme-only cluster from "likely unrelated" to a known operator's.
- **A named-identity bridge on ONE node can merge two artifact families.** A single page carrying one family's registrant email *and* another family's ahrefs token is enough to assert the two families are one operator — a single node that holds two families' private artifacts is attribution-grade glue.

## 3. Confidence calibration  ▢ TUNE

Blend source reliability × corroboration × recency into a 0–1 score. Starting model:

- base by tier (attribution-grade 0.9 / corroborating 0.6 / noise 0.3),
- **+** raise when ≥2 independent artifacts agree, **−** lower for stale data or single-source,
- keep the *provenance* — a claim's score is only as good as its `evidence_ref`.

▢ **Your calibration:** _the priors you actually trust per source (FOFA latest-index blind spots, urlscan freshness, WhoisXML history gaps), and how much a Vietnamese-registrar early record outweighs later privacy._

**Log every confidence call so the labels stay honest — `tools/kb/calibration.py`.** When you
assert a cluster/attribution, record it; when reality settles it, resolve it. `score` then tells
you whether your HIGHs actually land (Brier score + a per-label reliability table: are your
"high" calls confirmed ~85% of the time, or are you OVERconfident?). The judgement layer is an
*aid* — this is how you learn how much to trust it.
```bash
python3 tools/kb/calibration.py record --case <case> --claim "X,Y = one operator (reused GA4)" --confidence high
python3 tools/kb/calibration.py resolve --id <id> --outcome confirmed   # …later
python3 tools/kb/calibration.py score
```

## 4. Hypothesis loop  ▢ TUNE

For each cluster, state the hypothesis, then **actively try to break it**:

1. **Hypothesis:** "Domains X, Y, Z are one operator."
2. **Disconfirm:** look for the artifact that *shouldn't* be shared if true — a different
   registrant, a conflicting GA property, an IP in a different ASN. Absence of
   disconfirming evidence ≠ proof; note what you couldn't check.
3. **Next pivot:** pick the lead most likely to confirm *or* refute cheaply (see §5).

▢ **Your heuristics:** _the "what would I check next" instincts — the tells that make you
suspicious of a coincidence; when a clean story is too clean._

## 5. Pivot prioritisation  ▢ TUNE

Rank open leads by **expected yield ÷ cost** (cost = API credits, time, attribution risk):

- prefer passive + free (crt.sh, Wayback, existing KB) before paid (FOFA/WhoisXML credits),
- prefer artifacts that *split* the hypothesis (confirm or kill it) over ones that merely add volume,
- a reverse lookup on a *named identity* (e.g. reverse-WHOIS on a leaked registrant) usually
  outranks another favicon sweep.

▢ **Your priorities:** _the order you'd actually run things given a credit budget._

**Know when to STOP — `tools/kb/convergence.py`.** Pivoting has no natural finish line, so
define one: snapshot the case each round and stop when the last N rounds add no new hosts and
no new (noise-filtered) indicators. That's the signal to stop chasing the tail and write the
assessment.
```bash
python3 tools/kb/convergence.py snapshot <case>          # after each pivot round
python3 tools/kb/convergence.py status <case> --stale 2  # CONVERGED vs EXPANDING (+ budget)
```

> **Shared-infrastructure is filtered automatically — `tools/kb/noise_filters.py`.** A managed
> nameserver (Cloudflare/NameSilo), a parking favicon, a registrar/privacy abuse email, or a
> malformed GA4 (`g-recaptcha`) links unrelated domains without implying common ownership.
> `--shared` and the ingester now drop these at the source, so a `--shared` cluster is a real
> lead, not infra noise. If a new managed-DNS/parking provider slips through, add it to that file.

## 6. Conflict handling

The store keeps disagreements (WHOIS vs RDAP, two registrants across history). **Surface
the conflict in the assessment**; don't silently pick one. A conflict is often the signal
(e.g. a pre-privacy record naming the real owner vs the later proxy).

## 7. Assessment write-up standard  ▢ TUNE

- **BLUF** — the finding in one sentence, with a confidence word (assessed / likely / possible).
- **Cluster** — domains + the shared artifacts that bind them (a table, each row cited).
- **Attribution** — same-kit / same-operator / same-actor, and the evidence for the level claimed.
- **Gaps & alternatives** — what you couldn't verify, and the competing explanation you ruled out.
- **Next steps** — the prioritised open pivots.

▢ **Your format:** _house style, client-facing vs internal, how you phrase confidence for a legal/takedown audience._

---

## Worked example (illustrative — replace with your own as the KB grows)

`--shared` over the store yields: an ahrefs token on 4 domains, a GA4 property
`G-XXXXXXXXXX` + GTM + favicon on one brand family, a Messenger handle bridging two
sibling domains, and a leaked registrant name on a third domain. Triaged: those are all
attribution-grade except the Cloudflare NS (noise). Corroboration: ≥2 attribution-grade
artifacts across the set **and** a named identity → **assessed same-operator, one named
actor.** Next pivot (§5): reverse-WHOIS on the leaked registrant name (named identity >
another favicon sweep).
