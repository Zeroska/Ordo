"""
wp_liveness.py — is this host actually SERVING the operator's content? Decided by reading
the page, not by trusting the HTTP status code.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
"Is the domain live" was answered in three different places in this repo by three different
one-liners, and every one of them was a status-code check with a small hardcoded list of
parking strings bolted on. That is wrong in both directions, and both directions corrupt a
case silently:

  * **200 is not alive.** A registrar parking page, a freshly-provisioned `Welcome to nginx`
    default page, a host's "Account Suspended" notice and a soft-404 all return HTTP 200 with
    a complete HTML document. A status check calls all four LIVE, and the collector then
    harvests favicon hashes, analytics IDs and DOM fingerprints off a template shared by
    millions of unrelated domains — which is exactly how a parking favicon becomes a
    fifty-domain "operator cluster" that isn't one.
  * **404/403 is not dead.** The server ANSWERED. The name is registered, resolving, and
    pointed at infrastructure someone controls; only that path is gone (or we specifically
    are being refused). Marking it dead deletes a live lead from the case, and worse, it
    stops the re-check that would have caught the kit coming back at the same URL.

  * **A bot wall is not a verdict at all.** A Cloudflare interstitial means the page was never
    seen. That is absence of RECORD, not evidence of absence — the same discipline the
    capability layer applies to a missing API key. It classifies as `blocked`, live=None.

THE REUSE POINT
---------------
A domain that is parked, suspended, serving a server default page or answering 404 is still
UNDER SOMEONE'S CONTROL. Fraud operators park names between campaigns, rebuild on a new
provider after a takedown while keeping the domain, and stage infrastructure days before the
kit is uploaded. So every one of those states sets **`reuse_watch: True`** — meaning "this
name can be flipped to live content later; keep it on the re-check list". The only state that
evidences a name is genuinely gone is `unresolved` (NXDOMAIN), and even that is dormancy
rather than death while the registration is unexpired.

THE GUARDRAIL
-------------
`references/liveness.json` → `policy` holds four rules the classifier enforces on itself, so a
verdict cannot be produced from thin evidence:

    require_content_for_live   a `live` verdict REQUIRES that a body was actually read and
                               passed the marker + thin-content tests. A 200 with no body
                               read can never be reported as live — it degrades to `unknown`.
    never_dead_from_status     no HTTP status code, alone, may produce dead=True. Only DNS
                               non-resolution does.
    never_dead_when_blocked    a bot-wall hit forces live=None.
    min_signals                a verdict resting on fewer than N independent signals
                               (status / content / visible-text volume / DNS / nameservers)
                               comes back `confident: False`, so the report hedges.

All the matching values — parking markers, parking nameservers, soft-404 strings, suspension
notices, server-default pages, bot walls, thresholds and the state vocabulary itself — are
DATA in `WebPivot/references/liveness.json` (contributor RULE 3), so an analyst extends them
without touching this file.
