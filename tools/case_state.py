"""
case_state.py — resumable stage machine + gap/frontier extractor for the convergence loop.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
A case is worked as a feedback loop: collect (WebPivot) -> assess (IntelAnalysis) -> read the
assessment -> chase the unresolved gaps back into WebPivot -> repeat until nothing new can be
collected for free or the analyst says stop. Two things were missing to run that loop safely and
resumably, and this module supplies exactly those two:

  1. A single per-case STATE file (`cases/<case>/state.json`) — the loop's stage/cursor: status
     (expanding / converged / cold / awaiting-analyst), round number, the pending/collected/consumed
     seed queues, deferred metered leads, and a compact history. An interrupt leaves this on disk, so
     the next run RESUMES instead of restarting; a cold/old case re-opened after new evidence lands
     re-mines its frontier against the CURRENT knowledge base and picks up cross-case breakthroughs.

  2. A FRONTIER extractor — the bridge nothing had before. It mines each collected `raw/*.json` for
     concrete NEW candidate domains already discovered *for free* during the round (crt.sh SAN
     siblings, passive-DNS co-hosted hosts, urlscan related domains, TLS co-SAN cross-apex, CORS
     trusted origins, impersonation lookalikes, and any reverse-WHOIS siblings a prior keyed run
     left behind), reduces them to new registrable apexes, drops shared-infra/noise, and dedupes
     against everything already collected/queued. CO-TENANCY is rejected before it can seed: a
     multi-tenant TLS cert (> MAX_CERT_APEXES apexes), a shared/bulk-hosting or CDN IP
     (> MAX_IP_COHOSTS apexes), and a bulk/privacy registrant term (> MAX_WHOIS_SIBLINGS domains)
     all name other CUSTOMERS, not the operator's siblings — they are held back as
     `co_tenancy_leads` for a deliberate check instead of auto-collected, because a bad seed is not
     just a wasted fetch: it is ingested, and becomes a fake shared indicator in every later case.
     Pivots that would need a METERED call to expand
     (FOFA ip=/icon_hash=, WhoisXML reverse) are NOT auto-run — they are recorded as `metered_leads`
     for analyst approval, honoring "auto-chase on free sources only; pause before spending credits."

This module is deterministic and side-effect-free except for reading/writing state.json; the round
loop that calls it lives in `tools/intel.py loop`. Convergence itself is delegated to the existing
`tools/kb/convergence.py` (single authority: it owns rounds.jsonl); here we only READ its verdict.

#     privacy or registrar-abuse address is one by definition) — likewise.

# ============================================================ assessment.md ownership
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# `cases/<case>/assessment.md` has two kinds of author: a TOOL that re-renders it every round,
# and the ANALYST who writes the real judgment. Both wrote to the same path, and the tool used
# plain `open(..., "w")` — so a hand-written assessment parked there was destroyed on the next
# run, silently. (`assessment.json` had a guard from the start; the markdown did not.)
#
# THE RULE: a writer may overwrite ONLY output it recognises as its OWN. Not "is this file
# generated by anything" — each renderer knows its own signature and keeps its hands off
# everything else. That way the loop never eats the analyst's file OR the other front-end's,
# and neither has to know about the other's format.
#
# Signature = a tuple of substrings that must ALL appear near the top of the file; a writer
# passes a list of such tuples (its formats, current and historical). Fails CONSERVATIVE: a file
# that cannot be read is assumed precious and is never overwritten. Over-protecting costs a stale
# sidecar; under-protecting costs the analyst's work, so the asymmetry is deliberate.

# `WebPivot/tools/evidence_report.py` — the cluster report and the single-host `--report`.
# Used by tools/intel.py's convergence loop.

                      ("\n# Intelligence Assessment — ",))

# `# Assessment`, so it is paired with the `**BLUF —**` line to avoid matching an analyst's
# `# Assessment — <title>`.
HARNESS_RENDER_MD = (("\n# Assessment\n", "**BLUF —**"),)
