ingest_webpivot.py — adapter: pivot_extract.py JSON  ->  attributed facts in the KB.

Turns one WebPivot collection into atomic, provenance-carrying facts and edges:
  * each shared artifact (favicon, GA4/GTM, verification token, registrant, name
    server) becomes an `indicator`/`email`/`person` entity, and the domain gets an
    attributed edge to it. Domains that share an indicator are thus auto-linked.
  * FOFA / urlscan / reverse-WHOIS live_results become edges from the DISCOVERED
    sibling domains to the same indicator, sourced to the engine that found them.
  * the raw pivot_extract JSON is copied to evidence/ so every fact is re-openable.

Idempotent: re-ingesting the same collection updates rather than duplicates.

Usage:
  python3 ingest_webpivot.py --kb knowledge cases/<case>/raw/*.json

    An advertiser id is the only artifact in this collector that identifies a PAYER. To run Google

    verified, billed account — and unlike a favicon or a template, it is not something a second
    operator can copy off the first. Every domain that account advertised gets an edge to the same
    indicator, which is what makes them cluster.

    Two guards, both of which fail toward LOSING a link rather than inventing one:

      - `agency_shaped` (from `clustering_policy.agency_domain_threshold`) marks an advertiser whose
        creatives point at many unrelated domains. That is a media buyer or affiliate network buying
        traffic FOR others, and fusing its clients into one operator would be the same mistake as
        clustering on a shared white-label platform. Those co-advertised domains are recorded as
        FACTS on the indicator, never as edges, so they stay visible as leads without joining a
        cluster.
      - the campaign OBJECT ids (`campaignid`/`adgroupid`/`creative`) are short integers, so they get
        the medium weight their base rate deserves.

    Cloaking is deliberately NOT an indicator. It is a property of one page — this host serves paid
    clicks a different page than everyone else — so it lands as a high-confidence FACT on the domain.
