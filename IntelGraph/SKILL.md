name: IntelGraph
description: Generate publication-quality charts, graphs, timelines, Gantt charts, and relationship diagrams from threat-intelligence and OSINT reports — a high-res PNG/SVG/PDF for embedding plus an analytical thumbnail, via matplotlib, Mermaid, or Graphviz with a clean editorial (non-AI-looking) theme; English and Vietnamese labels. Also renders WebPivot case graphs (scripts/render_network.py) and the infrastructure LIFECYCLE timeline — domain registration/expiry spans, registrant eras, IP hosting windows, certificate validity, archive visibility — from a case's pivot JSON (scripts/case_timeline.py), with an evidence ledger citing every dated fact to an online source link. USE WHEN the user pastes or uploads an intelligence report, IOC table, incident timeline, campaign summary, or actor-infrastructure mapping, or asks for a chart, graph, timeline, Gantt, diagram, network graph, or visualization from investigative/CTI data — even if they don't say the word "skill".

# IntelGraph — Graph Design

Turn intelligence reports into clean, credible, report-ready graphics. The house style is understated and editorial — the kind of figure that looks hand-built by an analyst in a SOC report, not auto-generated. No gradients, no drop shadows, no rainbow palettes, no 3D.

## Running the tools — paths & working directory (read first)

This skill is registered as `IntelGraph`, symlinked to the repo's `IntelGraph/` folder.
Pick **one** anchor and use it consistently:

```bash
GRAPH=~/.claude/skills/IntelGraph          # absolute — works from any CWD (preferred)
# or, when working inside the repo:  GRAPH="$ROOT/IntelGraph"
python3 "$GRAPH/scripts/render_mermaid.py"  diagram.mmd  outputs/stem   # via mmdc
python3 "$GRAPH/scripts/render_graphviz.py" graph.dot    outputs/stem   # needs graphviz/dot
python3 "$GRAPH/scripts/render_network.py"  case_graph.json network.html --title "..."
python3 "$GRAPH/scripts/case_timeline.py"   CASE/out/*.json --stem CASE/timeline --markdown
# theme.py + gantt.py:  sys.path.insert(0, "<GRAPH>/scripts")
```

Every `IntelGraph/scripts/…` or bare `scripts/…` path shown later in this file means
`$GRAPH/scripts/…`; any `<WebPivot>/tools/…` means `~/.claude/skills/WebPivot/tools/…`.

Dependencies: see `requirements.txt` (`matplotlib`, `graphviz`; Mermaid uses the `mmdc` binary).
`render_mermaid.py` works out of the box wherever `mmdc` is installed; matplotlib/Graphviz paths
need their deps present.

## Core workflow

1. **Read the input.** Extract the structured data hiding in the prose: dates, IOCs, actor names, kill-chain phases, victim counts, ASN/infra links, TTPs, confidence gradings (Admiralty A1–F6). If a table or JSON is provided, use it directly.
2. **Pick the chart type** (see selection table below).
3. **Choose the engine** — matplotlib for data plots, Mermaid for flows/timelines/simple Gantt, Graphviz for entity-relationship / infrastructure graphs.
4. **Set language.** Default English. If the user asks for Vietnamese (or the report is in Vietnamese), pass `--lang vi`. Labels come from `references/i18n.md`.
5. **Render TWO artifacts per figure:**
   - `*_hires.png` (300 DPI) **and** `*.svg` / `*.pdf` — for embedding in the report.
   - `*_thumb.png` (110 DPI, smaller canvas) — the "analytical" quick-look for understanding your own work at a glance.
6. **Present both** with `present_files`, hi-res first.

**Output contract:** when the figure belongs to a case, save it into that case, not a loose
`outputs/`. Network graphs → `cases/<case>/` beside the assessment; standalone/ad-hoc figures →
`outputs/`. Always emit the full artifact set the figure type
promises (hi-res PNG + SVG/PDF + thumb for matplotlib; the single self-contained `network.html`
for `render_network.py`). Same case + same input JSON → same output filenames, so a re-render
overwrites rather than accumulating stray files.

## Network / link-analysis graphs (clustered, interactive) — USE THIS for relationship webs

For OSINT/CTI **link analysis** (domains ↔ trackers ↔ IPs ↔ wallets ↔ operator), do **not** use Mermaid or Graphviz — a dense relationship web becomes a hairball. Use the interactive network engine:

```bash
# 1) build a clustered graph model from WebPivot pivot JSON (Louvain communities + betweenness centrality)
python3 <WebPivot>/tools/graph_build.py out/*.json --operator "name" --operator-links a.com,b.com -o case_graph.json
# 2) render ONE self-contained interactive HTML (Cytoscape.js + fcose, all inlined — CSP-safe, no server)
python3 scripts/render_network.py case_graph.json network.html \
  --title "One operator, N sites — clustered by shared artifacts" \
  --subtitle "size = broker centrality · color = cluster · shape = type. Red = same-operator, purple = same-kit."
```
Encoding (research-backed): **node size = betweenness centrality**, **color = Louvain community**, **shape = entity type**, **solid = confirmed / dashed = inferred**, edge color = operator(red)/kit(purple)/link(grey)/infra(steel). Interactions: focus+context click, filters (edge evidence class, node type), color-by toggle (cluster↔type), layout toggle (organic/radial/hierarchy), search, detail panel. Libraries are vendored in `vendor/` (~760 KB, MIT). Tell the story: title = the claim; lead seed → mechanism → network → operator convergence; keep "same kit" and "same operator" edges visually separate.

**Engine choice:** relationship web / clustering → `render_network.py` (this). Attack flow / kill-chain / provenance tree → Mermaid or Graphviz. Data charts / Gantt / timeline → matplotlib (`theme.py`, `gantt.py`).

### Editable diagram export (for reports) — `graph_to_diagram.py`

`render_network.py` produces an opaque, interactive HTML — perfect for exploring a dense web
live, but you can't hand-edit it or embed it in a PDF/DOCX. When you need the case graph as a
**static, editable figure for a report**, convert the *same* `case_graph.json` into an
**editable Mermaid source** (`.mmd`) and render it to the PNG/SVG/thumb triple:

```bash
python3 scripts/graph_to_diagram.py case_graph.json out/case_diagram \
    --title "One operator, N sites" --legend        # + --direction LR|TB  --no-render
```
Writes `out/case_diagram.mmd` (hand-editable — rename a cluster, prune a node, fix a label)
then `out/case_diagram.svg`, `_hires.png`, `_thumb.png` via `render_mermaid.py`. Encoding is
faithful to the HTML: **node shape = entity type**, **node fill = Louvain cluster**, operator
= red anchor, **edge color = evidence class** (operator/kit/infra/link), **dashed = inferred**.
Use this figure with the **IntelReport** skill to build the PDF/DOCX. Both outputs coexist —
`render_network.py` (interactive HTML) is unchanged and still the right tool for live triage.
Rendering needs `mmdc` + headless Chrome (same as any Mermaid figure).

## The timeline figure — `case_timeline.py`  (run this on every case)

The network graph answers *what is connected*; it cannot answer *were they connected at the same
time*, and that is the question every same-operator claim actually rests on. Two hosts on one IP
in windows that never overlap are a recycled address, not co-tenants. Build the temporal view
**before** you draw conclusions from the relationship web:

```bash
python3 scripts/case_timeline.py cases/<case>/out/*.json \
    --stem cases/<case>/timeline --title "Infrastructure lifecycle — N domains" \
    --markdown --history cases/<case>/out/wayback_*.json \
    --source "OSINT collection" --grading B2 [--lang vi] [--max-certs 12] [--max-lanes 24]
```

Three artifacts, one run:

| Output | What it is |
|---|---|
| `timeline_hires.png` / `.svg` / `_thumb.png` | the swimlane figure for the report |
| `timeline_events.json` | the **evidence ledger** — every dated fact with its source + online link |
| `timeline.md` (`--markdown`) | paste-ready evidence table + the derived correlations |

**Encoding** — one lane per host, stacked sub-tracks per interval kind: registration
(created→expires, sand) · registrant era from WHOIS history (ochre) · hosting window from passive
DNS (steel) · certificate validity from CT (olive) · archive visibility (hatched — a *crawl*
schedule, deliberately weaker-looking than the records of control) · artifact-presence window
(slate). Brick diamonds on the strip below each lane are point observations (WHOIS update,
capture, scan). A dotted rule marks *now*, so a lapsed registration reads at a glance.

**It also does the temporal correlation for you** (in the `.md` and the ledger's
`correlations` block), each with the caveat that could kill it: registration cohorts · **expiry /
renewal cohorts** · same-day WHOIS updates · certificate issuance batches · **IP-tenancy overlap**
(co-tenant vs *sequential tenancy*) · shared-artifact window overlap · abandonment cohorts. The
tradecraft for reading those is IntelAnalysis §1.5 — this tool computes them, the analyst judges
them.

Inputs are the case's `pivot_extract` JSON. Richness follows collection: RDAP/WHOIS gives the
registration spine keylessly, CT gives cert windows, **passive DNS (`PDNS_*` credentials) is what
gives real hosting windows** — without it you get scans and live DNS, i.e. points, not intervals.
`--max-certs` / `--max-lanes` bound the figure and the omitted counts are **printed, never hidden**.

## Evidence rule — cite time, source and an ONLINE link (never a file path)

Every figure and every table this skill produces is an exhibit someone else has to be able to
re-check. So each dated claim carries four things: **what · when (UTC) · source · a public URL**.

- **Links must resolve for a reader who has no access to the case store.** Wayback snapshot,
  archive.today, urlscan result, crt.sh cert id, RDAP record, BGP. A `cases/<case>/out/x.json`
  path is our *collection record* — it may appear in an internal appendix, never as the citation.
- **Prefer a frozen copy over a search.** `web.archive.org/web/<ts>/<url>` and
  `urlscan.io/result/<uuid>/` still show what you saw; `crt.sh/?q=…` moves under the reader.
- **No public copy yet? Make one before you assert** — `pivot_extract --archive-missing` (Wayback
  Save Page Now) or a urlscan submission — then cite what you created.
- **Caption every figure with its observation window**, not just a render date: a chart built from
  a 2024 capture is a 2024 claim no matter when the PNG was written.
- The link templates and the per-source Admiralty grades live in
  `references/evidence_sources.json` — add a service there (no code change) rather than
  hand-writing URL shapes.

## Chart type selection

| Input signal | Chart | Engine |
|---|---|---|
| Counts over categories (malware families, targeted banks, ASNs) | Horizontal bar | matplotlib |
| Trend over time (phishing domains/day, detections/week) | Line / step | matplotlib |
| Proportions (infra by country, IOC by type) | Donut (never pie-3D) | matplotlib |
| Two-metric relationship | Scatter | matplotlib |
| Event sequence with dates | Timeline | `gantt.py` (matplotlib) |
| Overlapping activity windows (campaign phases, IR tasks) | Gantt | `gantt.py` (matplotlib) |
| **A case's infrastructure over time** — when each domain was registered/expired, who held it, which IP hosted it when, which certs covered it | **Lifecycle swimlane** | **`case_timeline.py`** (matplotlib) |
| Attack progression | Kill-chain / flow | Mermaid or Graphviz |
| Actor ↔ infra ↔ victim links | Relationship graph | Graphviz |
| Matrix (Diamond Model, MITRE coverage, C1–C8 scoring) | Heatmap | matplotlib |

When unsure which of two fits, generate the matplotlib version — it's the most reliable and most "report-native."

## The theme (non-negotiable house style)

All matplotlib output MUST load the shared theme so figures are visually consistent:

```python
import sys; sys.path.insert(0, "SCRIPTS_DIR")
from theme import apply_theme, PALETTE, save_dual
apply_theme(lang="en")   # or "vi"
```

Theme rules baked into `scripts/theme.py`:
- Font: DejaVu Sans (renders Vietnamese diacritics correctly — cà phê, Hà Nội, lừa đảo).
- Muted, colorblind-safe palette (slate/steel/ochre/brick), no neon.
- Left-aligned title + smaller grey subtitle, hairline gridlines on one axis only, despined top/right.
- A caption footer line for source + Admiralty grading + date stamp.
- White background, generous margins — reads as print, not dashboard.

## Rendering matplotlib figures

Use `scripts/theme.py` helpers. Minimal pattern:

```python
import sys; sys.path.insert(0, "IntelGraph/scripts")
from theme import apply_theme, PALETTE, save_dual, caption
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

apply_theme(lang="en")
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(9, 5))
ax.barh(labels, values, color=PALETTE["primary"])
ax.set_title("Fake banking APK families observed", loc="left", fontweight="bold")
caption(fig, source="CTI team", grading="B2", date="2026-07-05")
save_dual(fig, "outputs/apk_families")  # writes _hires.png (300dpi), .svg, _thumb.png
```

`save_dual(fig, stem)` produces `stem_hires.png`, `stem.svg`, and `stem_thumb.png` in one call. Add `pdf=True` for a vector PDF too.

See `references/matplotlib_recipes.md` for ready-to-adapt code for bar, line, donut, scatter, heatmap (Diamond Model / C1–C8), and matplotlib-native timeline.

## Rendering Gantt & timeline (default: browser-free)

Prefer the matplotlib-native `scripts/gantt.py` — it needs no browser, matches the data-chart house style exactly, and handles Vietnamese. Use it for Gantt charts and event timelines:

> **`gantt.py` vs `case_timeline.py`:** `gantt.py` draws a list of dates **you** supply (campaign
> phases, IR tasks, a narrative of events from a report). `case_timeline.py` **derives** the
> timeline from the case's collected JSON and cites each row — use it for anything about the
> investigated infrastructure itself.

```python
import sys; sys.path.insert(0, "IntelGraph/scripts")
from gantt import gantt, timeline
tasks = [
  {"section":"Infrastructure","name":"Domain registration","start":"2026-05-01","end":"2026-05-07"},
  {"section":"Response","name":"Detection & report","start":"2026-05-16","end":"2026-05-18","crit":True},
]
gantt(tasks, title="Campaign timeline — fake banking APK",
      stem="outputs/campaign_gantt",
      lang="en", source="CTI team", grading="B2", date="2026-07-05")
```
`crit=True` highlights a task (brick); `done=True` greys it. `timeline([(date,label),...], ...)` renders an alternating event timeline. Both emit the hi-res + SVG + thumb triple.

## Rendering Mermaid (flow, kill-chain — needs headless Chrome)

Mermaid is best for attack flows / kill-chains. It requires `mmdc` **and headless Chrome**. If Chrome isn't installed, run once:
```bash
npx puppeteer browsers install chrome-headless-shell
```
(this needs network access to the puppeteer CDN; if the environment blocks it, use Graphviz for flows instead). Then:
```bash
python IntelGraph/scripts/render_mermaid.py diagram.mmd outputs/killchain
```
See `references/mermaid_recipes.md` for Gantt, timeline, kill-chain, and flow templates (English + Vietnamese). For flows without Chrome, use the Graphviz `flowchart` equivalent in `references/graphviz_recipes.md`.

## Rendering Graphviz (entity / infrastructure graphs)

For actor→infrastructure→victim link analysis:

```bash
python IntelGraph/scripts/render_graphviz.py graph.dot outputs/infra_map
```

See `references/graphviz_recipes.md` for the DOT template with node shapes per entity type (actor=box, domain=ellipse, IP=hexagon, victim=folder, wallet=cylinder).

## Vietnamese output

When `--lang vi` / `lang="vi"`:
- matplotlib: `apply_theme(lang="vi")` keeps DejaVu Sans and switches built-in furniture (axis defaults, caption words like "Nguồn", "Độ tin cậy", "Cập nhật").
- Look up chart titles / recurring analytic terms in `references/i18n.md` (kill-chain phases, Diamond Model vertices, Admiralty labels, common CTI nouns).
- Translate the substantive labels the user gives you; keep proper nouns (brand names, FOFA, ASN numbers) as-is.
- If the user provides English data but wants a Vietnamese figure, translate labels but leave IOCs, hashes, domains untouched.

## Quality checklist before presenting

- Two files exist: a hi-res AND a thumbnail.
- Every dated claim in the figure/table cites **when · source · a resolvable online link** — no
  local case-store paths, no uncited timestamps.
- A timeline's intervals are intervals: a shared IP or artifact is drawn (and described) as a
  window, and the assessment says whether the windows **overlap**.
- Vietnamese text renders with correct diacritics (no tofu boxes).
- Caption footer has source + confidence grading + date.
- No 3D, no default matplotlib blue, no gradient fills.
- Numbers in the figure match the source report.
- Title states the finding, not just the variable ("Phishing infra concentrated in 3 ASNs", not "ASN counts").
